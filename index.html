   Abstract  
   </div>
   <p>
   The main focus of the Regenerative Braking Electric Skateboard senior design project will address and improve upon areas in both Electrical 
   Engineering as well as Mechanical Engineering aspects when it comes to electric skateboards. The electrical engineers of
   the team will be tasked with solving the problems that come with regenerative braking, such as not being able to brake when 
   the batteries are fully charged. The mechanical engineers are tasking themselves to create an automatic truck adjusting system, which
   will give the rider much better control dependent on the speed of the rider.<br>

   Background 
   </div>
   <p>
   Regenerative	braking is not a new concept when it comes to electric skateboards. Most electric motors can easily generate a current 
   if they are manually spun, so it only makes sense to generate some extra charge when going down hills. The problem with most 
   regenerative braking skateboards is that when the batteries are full, there is nowhere for the current to go, meaning you
   are unable to use these regenerative brakes. On top of that, many skateboards are capable of generating too much current when
   going down steep hills, which could potentially fry the circuits and pose another safety hazzard. Another problem being addressed
   is a problem with every skateboard, not just electric ones. It is possible to tighten or loosen the trucks on a skateboard to give
   you more control depending on your desired speed. This would be beneficial to have as an automatic system, giving the rider 
   more control depending on the speed they are currently going.

   Project Objectives
   </div>
   <p>
	Our project will be broken up into several steps to keep us on track. The first step is to build a simple electric longboard 
	without any of the new improvements. Here, we will practice designing brackets and mounts, intalling hardware, and programming
	the microcontroller. Once we have this prototype functional, we will begin to design a much more complicated mountain board. 
	The second board will be a mountain board. On top of the functionality of the first board, it will also include the 
	mechanical and electrical upgrades to both the regenerative brakes, as well as the automatically adjusting trucks.
	This board will require more complicated software and hardware, as well as mechanical mounts and structural components.
