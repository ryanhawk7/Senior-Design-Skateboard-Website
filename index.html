            Abstract  
          </div>
          <p>
            The Regenerative Braking Electric Skateboard senior design project is an entrepreneurship project with the overarching 
            goal of creating a market competitive product. Both Electrical Engineering as well as Mechanical Engineering will be 
            applied to identify and address areas of improvement. The electrical engineers of the team have been tasked with solving 
            the problems that come with regenerative braking, such as not being able to brake when the batteries are fully charged. 
            They will handle all electrical components of the two electric skateboards. This includes a homemade battery pack with a battery
            management system, a custom Electric Speed Controller, and a chopper circuit connected to a rheostatic braking resistor to dissipate 
            any excess current as heat. The mechanical engineers have tasked themselves to create an adaptive truck system, which will give the rider much better 
            control depending on the speed of the rider. They will also be handling any of the enclosure designs, the motor mounts and pulley system, material selection 
            and testing, and any designs required for heat transfer.

            Background 
          </div>
            <p>
              Regenerative	braking is not a new concept, but is largely underdeveloped in small electric vehicles. As other areas 
              are continually pushed by innovation, namely batteries and motors, the need for improvement upon regenerative braking 
              grows. Regenerative brakes convert the kinetic energy of the electric vehicle and its rider back into electrical energy. 
              The equation for kinetic energy states that it is proportional to the squared velocity of the object moving. As electric 
              skateboards continually push the boundaries of speed for small electric vehicles, they are also continually increasing the
              amount of kinetic energy lost. Two major problems face the majority of electric skateboards with regenerative braking on the 
              market today. The first and largest problem being addressed is the inability to brake when the batteries are completely charged. 
              The second problem is that as speeds continually increase, so does the likelihood of generating too much current and overloading
              the system. Another entirely separate issue in the mechanical space is also unresolved, with no solutions currently on the market.
              It is possible to tighten or loosen the trucks on a skateboard to give you more control depending on your desired speed. This would 
              be beneficial to have as an automatic system, giving the rider more control depending on the speed they are currently going.

            Project Objectives
          </div>
          <p>
	          The project is broken down into two separate but equally important parts. Two prototype boards will be built with 
	          different focuses on each. One board will primarily focus on the entrepreneurial aspect of the project. Existing parts 
	          will be bought where available so that the focus of the board can be on the regenerative braking capabilities as well as 
        	  the automatic adaptive truck system. Any additional components or improvements will need to be fully implemented with the 
	          prebuilt parts utilized on this board. The main focus will be to make this board as competitively viable as possible by putting
	          considerable effort into an easy to install, separate system which will control the truck adjustment, as well as any improvements 
	          to the regenerative braking capabilities that can be easily added to the existing market components.
