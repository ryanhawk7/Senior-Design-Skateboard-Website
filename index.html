            Abstract  
          </div>
          <p>
            The Regenerative Braking Electric Skateboard senior design project is an entrepreneurship project with the overarching 
            goal of creating a market competitive product. Both Electrical Engineering as well as Mechanical Engineering will be 
            applied to identify and address areas of improvement. The electrical engineers of the team have been tasked with solving 
            the problems that come with regenerative braking, such as not being able to brake when the batteries are fully charged. 
            They will handle all electrical components of the two electric skateboards. This includes a homemade battery pack with a battery
            management system, a custom Electric Speed Controller, and a chopper circuit connected to a rheostatic braking resistor to dissipate 
            any excess current as heat. The mechanical engineers have tasked themselves to create an adaptive truck system, which will give the rider much better 
            control depending on the speed of the rider. They will also be handling any of the enclosure designs, the motor mounts and pulley system, material selection 
            and testing, and any designs required for heat transfer.

            Background 
          </div>
            <p>
              Regenerative	braking is not a new concept, but is largely underdeveloped in small electric vehicles. As other areas 
              are continually pushed by innovation, namely batteries and motors, the need for improvement upon regenerative braking 
              grows. Regenerative brakes convert the kinetic energy of the electric vehicle and its rider back into electrical energy. 
              The equation for kinetic energy states that it is proportional to the squared velocity of the object moving. As electric 
              skateboards continually push the boundaries of speed for small electric vehicles, they are also continually increasing the
              amount of kinetic energy lost. Two major problems face the majority of electric skateboards with regenerative braking on the 
              market today. The first and largest problem being addressed is the inability to brake when the batteries are completely charged. 
              The second problem is that as speeds continually increase, so does the likelihood of generating too much current and overloading
              the system. Another entirely separate issue in the mechanical space is also unresolved, with no solutions currently on the market.
              It is possible to tighten or loosen the trucks on a skateboard to give you more control depending on your desired speed. This would 
              be beneficial to have as an automatic system, giving the rider more control depending on the speed they are currently going.

            Project Objectives
          </div>
          <p>
	          The project is broken down into two separate but equally important parts. The objective of the project is to
            address four areas of improvement which will give the project the largest increase in value as a marketable product.
            Increasing the range of the board through improved regenerative braking will greatly increase the value. Solving the issues
            of braking while the battery is full and redirecting excess current will make the board more safe and more valuable to 
            potential customers. And finally, an adaptive truck system will provide additional control and therefore more safety. 
            These problems are broken up into the regenerative braking improvement and the adaptive truck system. We believe that these 
            improvements will provide the greatest possibly of success as an entrepreneurship venture.
