          <div class = "flexParagraph">Hello, my name is Fawzi Al Hadrab and I am a senior at Colorado State University (CSU) pursuing a B.S. in Electrical
            Engineering. Over the past three years I have spent at CSU, I have had a continuous growth in passion to concentrate on
            power and controls. During my time working with a group of engineers in Kuwait, I was filled in about multiple 
            vulnerabilities to the power grid with potential proposed solutions. The board of engineers was assigned to figure out 
            the feasibility of the proposed solutions. Working with the board of engineers closely inspired me to
            pursue Power Engineering.</div>

          <div class = "flexParagraph">My name is Bradley George and I am a Senior Mechanical Engineering Student. I have always had a passion for 
            aviation, but this passion has slowly expanded to nearly all high-speed vehicles. I am looking forward to gaining experience 
            in the Mechanical Engineering field and seeing what kind of high-tech projects that I can be apart of.

          <div class = "flexParagraph">Hi there, my name is Ryan, and I am a final year ECE student at Colorado State University. Before studying to be 
            an Electrical Engineering, I dual majored in Biomedical Engineering and Chemical and Biological Engineering, before
            finding out that Electrical Engineering was a much better fit for me. Despite preferring to working with my hands on physical 
            hardware, I also have a passion for Front End Development. I also love 3D printing, 3D modeling, gardening, and cooking!</div>
