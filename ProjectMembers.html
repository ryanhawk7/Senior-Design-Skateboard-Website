        <p>Mechanical Engineer</p>
        <p>My name is Bradley George and I am a Senior Mechanical Engineering Student. I learned how to longboard as a second
		year at Colorado State when walking to class became overrated. Now that riding a traditional longboard has become overrated,
		I am excited to develop a better way to ride. Throughout my experience as a mechanical engineer, I have developed a strong
		interest in the design process, CAD, and structure and flow analysis using simulation software..</p>

        <p>Electrical Engineer</p>
        <p>Hello, my name is Fawzi Al Hadrab and I am a senior at Colorado State University (CSU) pursuing a B.S. in Electrical
		Engineering. Over the past three years I have spent at CSU, I have had a continuous growth in passion to concentrate on
		power and controls. During my time working with a group of engineers in Kuwait, I was filled in about multiple 
		vulnerabilities to the power grid with potential proposed solutions. The board of engineers was assigned to figure out 
		the feasibility of the proposed solutions. Working with the board of engineers closely inspired me to
		pursue Power Engineering.</p>

        <p>Electrical Engineer</p>
        <p>Hi there, my name is Ryan, and I am a final year ECE student at Colorado State University. Before studying to be 
		an Electrical Engineering, I dual majored in Biomedical Engineering and Chemical and Biological Engineering, before
		finding out that Ecetrical Engineering was a much better fit for me. Despite prefering to working with my hands on physical 
		hardware, I also have a passion for Front End Development. I also love 3D printing, 3D modeling, gardening, and cooking! </p>

        <h2>Dr. Ali Pezeshki</h2>
        <p>Faculty Advisor</p>
        <p>Ali Pezeshki received the BSc and MSc degrees in electrical engineering from University of Tehran, Tehran, 
		Iran, in 1999 and 2001, respectively. He earned his PhD degree in electrical engineering at Colorado State University 
		in 2004. In 2005, he was a postdoctoral research associate with the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at 
		Colorado State University. From January 2006 to August 2008, he was a postdoctoral research associate with The Program
		in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Princeton University. In August 2008, he joined the faculty of Colorado State
		University, where he is now a Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and the Department of
		Mathematics. His research interests are in statistical signal processing, machine learning, optimization, coding theory,
		geometry, applied harmonic analysis, and bioimaging. He served on the editorial board of IEEE ACCESS from 2012 to 2018</p>
